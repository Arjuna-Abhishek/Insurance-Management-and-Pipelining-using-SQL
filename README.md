This project's goal was Creating a robust database system to support Blue Cross Insurance's key business processes was the project's main objective. Blue Cross offers a range of insurance products to clients in the area, including business, home, auto, life, and health insurance.


Agile methodology is used in the implementation process, which includes requirements
gathering, database/app development, user testing, and migration/integration. Before the system
is used by the entire organization, a gradual rollout begins with the claims workflow for
validation.
Once implemented, the database will serve as the analytical foundation, facilitating crossfunctional insight through business intelligence (BI) for improved operational decision making,
risk assessments, fraud detection, and strategic planning. It will also support everyday
transactions.
